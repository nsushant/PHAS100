# Week 3 Exercises
## Classes, Inheritance, and Exceptions

This repo should be downloaded and the container build _before class_ to save time on building containers when we should be doing exercises. 

Once again the `CMakeLists.txt` files have been provided for you, so you can build each of those mini-projects (including exectutables and any tests) by going into the folder (`Fractions`, `Students`, or `Animals`) and typing:
```bash=
cmake -B build
cmake --build build
```
**Note that these will not successfully build until you've done parts of the exercises.**

# Note that CMake reflects the source tree hierarchy in its build folder. Our aim is to now to instruct CMake to place all the binary executables within a `bin/` subdirectory within the build directory. Use the `set()` command, and the pre-defined variables CMAKE_RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY and CMAKE_BINARY_DIR
